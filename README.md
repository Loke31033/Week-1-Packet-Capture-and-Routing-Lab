# Week 1 â€“ Packet Capture and Routing Lab

## Objectives Completed
- [x] Built virtual lab with Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server
- [x] Captured and analyzed network traffic
- [x] Identified key protocols (DNS, ARP, ICMP, TCP)
- [x] Analyzed TCP 3-way handshake
- [x] Created 3-router topology in Packet Tracer
- [x] Configured static routing

## Part 1: Packet Capture Analysis

### ICMP and ARP Capture
[Screenshot: Wireshark ICMP packets]
**Analysis:** Captured ping traffic showing ICMP echo request/reply. Observed ARP resolution before ICMP communication.

### SSH and TCP 3-Way Handshake
[Screenshot: Wireshark TCP 3-way handshake]
**Analysis:** Identified the SYN-SYN/ACK-ACK sequence establishing the TCP connection for SSH.

### DNS and HTTP Capture

**Analysis:** Observed DNS resolution converting domain to IP, followed by HTTP GET request.

## Part 2: Packet Tracer Routing Lab

### Network Topology

## Key Learnings
- Practical understanding of core networking protocols
- Hands-on experience with traffic analysis
- Static routing configuration and troubleshooting
- Correlation between theoretical concepts and real-world traffic
